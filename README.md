# Phnom Penh Street Art: A Digital Archive

This project was developed in January 2026 as part of the **"Arts for Transformation"** J-term course at **New York University Abu Dhabi**. 

During a two-week immersive journey through Cambodia, our group of eleven students explored the intersection of local culture, history, and creative expression. Fascinated by the evolving urban landscape of Phnom Penh, three of us set out to document the city’s vibrant street art scene before these ephemeral works are lost to time or urban development.

## 📍 The Vision
Phnom Penh’s walls are a living canvas. However, street art is inherently temporary. **mapmymural.me** was built to bridge the gap between the physical streets and digital preservation. By mapping these murals, we aim to:
* **Recognize the Artists:** Give credit to the local and international creators shaping the city’s visual identity.
* **Preserve the Ephemeral:** Create a permanent record of works that may eventually be painted over or demolished.
* **Connect the Community:** Provide a tool for locals and travelers to discover the hidden galleries tucked away in Phnom Penh’s alleys.

## 🤝 Community-Led Preservation
We believe an archive is most powerful when it belongs to everyone. This map is open for public contribution. If you find a new mural, a hidden tag, or a massive piece of public art, you can add it directly to our database. This ensures the map grows and changes alongside the city itself.

## 🏛️ The Collective
We are a team of students from NYU Abu Dhabi, bringing together different perspectives to document this cultural shift:
* **Gonzalo Hurtado Andablo** | Economics, Class of 2029
* **Katya Cundric** | Psychology, Class of 2026
* **Manoj Dhakal** | Philosophy & Computer Science, Class of 2026

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Explore:** Use the "Home" and "Map" tabs to see the current state of the city's street art.
2. **Learn:** Check the "About" section for the story behind our J-term project and our ties to NYUAD.
3. **Contribute:** Follow the steps on the "Contribute" page to add a new mural. You just need a location and a photo.
